excerpt: 'Functional photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) requires laser sources with multiple wavelengths targeting abundant substances, where lipid and water are important components of living organisms. Here, we propose to use a single compact dual-wavelength passively Q-switched solid-state laser as the excitation source to directly achieve PA differentiation of water and lipid simultaneously. The main contribution of our work is to use the excitation difference under 1064- and 1176-nm lasers for mapping water and lipid in PAM, respectively. Meanwhile, the miniature structure (cavity size: ∼10 × 10 × 5.5 mm3) of the laser source is not only promising for portable applications but also benefts the PA-desired nanosecond (<2 ns) laser pulse establishment. Our technique is confrmed by effcient PA imaging of water and lipid in biological tissues at high spatial resolution and improved sensitivity. This laser provides a novel and low-cost imaging source for PAM to track changes in water and lipid distribution<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>'
